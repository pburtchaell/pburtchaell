# Hey y'all  üëãüèª

I'm passionate about design to solve fundamental problems in the world. I believe the internet and digital technology can be a positive force for good, but that design must integrate privacy, safety, well-being and accessibility considerations. We must design for the real world. 

I value quality and craft, and solving fundamental problems with simple, yet innovative products. As a leader, I strive to recognize and activate the potential in people and process on my team.

I have 5+ years of experience working on a diverse slate of teams, including Facebook app growth, Messenger privacy, Instagram direct messages, and several startups.

Bit more about me:

- I'm based in the United States
- I currently work on end-to-end encryption at Messenger
- I also maintain a few open source projects for React & Redux
- I have a B.Des and went to school at Loyola University New Orleans
